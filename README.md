Project Description:

 This program is a structured family hierarchy that aims to represent a family tree by organizing the information of family members and displaying their roles in a console-based interaction. The program serves as a valuable tool for comprehending and managing family roles, making it easier to understand the relationships and responsibilities within a family.





 
Importance and Contribution:

The code is used as an educational resource for users, particularly students studying object-oriented programming concepts. By studying and interacting with the code, users can obtain a hands-on understanding of how inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction function in reality. It also provides a basis for documenting family relationships and tracing ancestral lines, allowing users to build family trees and track historical data, making family history and heritage analyze easier.
